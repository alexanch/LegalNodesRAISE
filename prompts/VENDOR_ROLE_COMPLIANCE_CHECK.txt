DATA_SECURITY_COMPLIANCE_CHECK

Objective:  
Evaluate whether the Vendor’s DPA includes sufficient technical and organizational security measures and defines clear liability provisions in the event of a personal data breach.

Instructions:  
You are reviewing the Vendor’s DPA. Assess the following controls:

---

1. SECURITY MEASURES

Step 1: Is the Vendor certified under ISO 27001 or SOC 2?  
- [ ] Yes → Compare the list of Security Measures in the DPA with the required controls under ISO 27001 or SOC 2 (external benchmark)  
  - Are the measures from the DPA equivalent to or more comprehensive than those in ISO/SOC?  
    - [ ] Yes → Confirm that this Control is Satisfied  
    - [ ] No → Switch to “No” for certification and continue to internal benchmark

- [ ] No → Compare the list of Security Measures in the DPA with the client’s internal information security baseline (internal benchmark)  
  - Are the measures from the DPA equivalent to or more comprehensive than the internal baseline?  
    - [ ] Yes → Confirm that this Control is Satisfied  
    - [ ] No → Red Flag

Supporting quote(s):  
- "[Insert clause(s) from the DPA describing the implemented security measures]"  
- "[Insert mention of ISO/SOC certification, if available]"

---

2. VENDOR’S LIABILITY IN CASE OF DATA BREACH

Does the DPA include a clear clause outlining Vendor’s liability in the event of a personal data breach (e.g. financial liability, indemnification, or cost coverage)?  
- [ ] Yes → Confirm that this Control is Satisfied  
- [ ] No → Red Flag

Supporting quote(s):  
- "[Insert clause(s) from the DPA describing the Vendor’s obligations or liability for breach]"  
- "[Insert any language about indemnity, damages, or limitations]"
