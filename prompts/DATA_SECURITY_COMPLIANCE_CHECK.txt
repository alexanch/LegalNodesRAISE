DATA_SECURITY_COMPLIANCE_CHECK

Objective:
Assess whether the DPA contains adequate technical and organizational security measures. Determine if these measures comply with either ISO 27001 / SOC 2 (external benchmark) or the client’s internal information security baseline (internal benchmark).

Instructions:
You are reviewing the Vendor’s DPA. Answer the following control question based on decision logic and evidence from the DPA.

1. SECURITY MEASURES

Step 1: Is the Vendor certified under ISO 27001 or SOC 2?
- [ ] Yes → Compare the list of Security Measures in the DPA with the required controls of ISO 27001 or SOC 2 (external benchmark)
  - Are the measures from the DPA equivalent to the external benchmark?
    - [ ] Yes → Confirm that this Control is Satisfied
    - [ ] No → Switch to "No" for ISO/SOC certification → Proceed to Step 2

- [ ] No → Compare the list of Security Measures in the DPA with the internal baseline (client’s in-house infosec benchmark)
  - Are the measures from the DPA equivalent to the internal benchmark?
    - [ ] Yes → Confirm that this Control is Satisfied
    - [ ] No → Red Flag

Supporting quote(s):
- "[Insert direct quote(s) from the DPA listing the implemented security measures]"
- "[Insert mention of ISO 27001 or SOC 2 certification, if stated]"

Output Format:
